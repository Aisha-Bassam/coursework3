     * In the code snippet you provided, the expression (row << 16) is a bitwise left shift operation. 

       In Java, the shift operators << and >> move the bits of a binary number to the left or right by a specified number of positions. In this case, row << 16 means shifting the binary representation of the row integer left by 16 positions.

       When you shift bits to the left by 16 positions, you are effectively multiplying the row value by 2^16 (which is 65,536). This operation helps combine the row and col values into a single integer value for the hash code.

       As for the return type of the hashCode() method, it is declared as int, so the method must return an integer value. The result of (row << 16) + col is an integer value which is calculated by concatenating the shifted row value and the col value together.

       Essentially, the hashCode() method in your code snippet generates a hash code for some object based on the row and col values by combining them into a single integer value.
